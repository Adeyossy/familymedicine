          "I have the honour of being the editor for the second version of the family medicine residency training handbook. It has been 11 years since the first edition (November 2011). There have been considerable improvements to the residency training while the challenges were surmounted as they came. Each challenge provided a learning opportunity.",
          "Going through the previous Editor’s Note, one realises the historical perspective that it holds, hence its inclusion in the history section of this handbook.",
          "The initiative to revise the handbook came from the Head of Department, Dr Adedotun A Adetunji. He set up the Residency Handbook Review Committee in October 2022, comprising of the Residency Training Coordinator, Dr Kehinde Adigun, Dr ‘Bimbo Olorunsola (CME coordinator), Dr Oluwatoyin Olalemi, Dr Oyindamola Aderinto (Chief Resident), Dr Onaopepomipo Kolade (Senior Registrar), Dr Eniade Boriwaye (Registrar) and I. Even though Dr ‘Folajimi Senjobi was not part of the committee, he played a very important role in this edition especially for the abstracts of previous dissertations, a new feature added in this 2nd edition. Dr Olushola Mosuro coordinated the pictures, not a small feat!"

          "This digital aid to Family Medicine training is informed not just by fanciful pursuit of content upgrade, but by collective insight gleaned from the training program’s defiance of several odds over decades (including the COVID-19 pandemic recently).",
          "Our new resident doctors should certainly be proud to engage this app and to provide insightful feedback for its improvement, knowing that by doing so they enter into and venerate a long line of Family Medicine stalwarts who have made their mark and have contributed to the legacy of one of the best training programs in the University College Hospital, Ibadan.",

During the years of the Nigeria civil war (6th July 1967 - 15th January 1970) and the attendant disruption in health services, there was a large influx of patients and the after-hours emergency service had to be stopped due to work overload on the staff.",
          "This service was subsequently transferred to the Casualty Department. The name of the clinic was the therefore changed to the General Outpatients Department. It catered for all members of the public with or without referral letters and members of staff and their families. The services to the general public, staff and staff families, were eventually separated as two departments with their own staff complement as a result of improved structural organization. The General Out-patients Department apart from providing quality care to the general public eventually would commence the post graduate training in Family Medicine, whilst the Staff Medial Services provided for the staff and their families.",
          "The clinic thus gave medical care to a large number of people and afforded the junior medical staff the opportunity to gain experience in the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions that did not require specialist or in-patient care. They also learnt the early recognition of seriously ill patients.",

          "With the change of specialty name from GMP to Family Medicine at the turn of the millennium, the name of the department was eventually changed to Department of Family Medicine in 2005.  A more patient-centered type of care was instituted to further improve patient satisfaction. The Department of Family Medicine attended to about 60,000 patients annually before the Covid-19 pandemic. The numbers had since dropped and hopefully will pick up again.",
          "Family Medicine is the medical specialty that provides comprehensive and continuing health care for the individual in a holistic manner within the context of his family and environment.  It encompasses all ages, both sexes, and every disease entity, integrating biological, clinical and behavioral sciences.  It provides primary care and in Nigeria, the term “Frontline Doctor” has been adopted.",
