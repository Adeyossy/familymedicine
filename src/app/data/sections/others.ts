The resident doctors should be vigilant to seek all learning opportunities and not be hesitant or in a hurry to seek further clarification from the consultant teaching staff.",

The Directly Observed Procedural Skill (DOPS) form provides an ideal avenue to have a friendly and concerned observer of your development, give you feedback on what you got right and what you can improve upon. Seek to go above the minimum requirement, and show how your skills rating improves with time and training.",
            "Competence comes when you can perform skills with minimal supervision. A careful preparation before a task, gives observers confidence that you can be delegated a duty. This creates competence that always easy to spot during examinations and job interviews."
