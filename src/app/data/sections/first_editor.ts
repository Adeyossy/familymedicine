        "The postgraduate handbook on the Family Medicine Residency Programme in the University College Hospital has finally come to fruition after a long gestion! ",
        "I would like to immediately and especially appreciate the Chief Medical Director of the University College Hospital, Ibadan Professor Temitope Alonge, for providing the final push, by setting a date for release, and providing the funds to make the dream realisable.",
        "The gestation has indeed been long and was carried by many mothers! This is so true of our department that is truly a family. I was not privileged to meet the founders of our beloved department, but reading what they have put down in documents both in our department and in peer-review journals makes me realise how the spirit to serve and preserve, for posterity, was laid down right from the beginning. I had my residency training under Dr. A. Kalejaiye, who documented an amazing number of requests, reports, protocols and guidelines for teaching both undergraduate and postgraduate students.",
        "Dr. 'Lola Lopez-Chico, whom Dr. A. Kalejaiye always referred to as her right-hand-man, had  hand-notes of paediatrics and ophthalmology cases seen in the GOP that made me green with envy to have. I wonder if I can convince her to have these published now that we have such an enabling environment?",
        "These two amazing clinicians directed us wonderfully, establishing leadership by example that so typifies Family Medicine Department, UCH.",
        "Dr. M. M-A. Ladipo, the first resident doctor in Family Medicine and immediate past HOD, has the true spirit of the pioneer. She has an uncommonly sound mind; analytical, clear and concise, and incredibly retentive. Dr. Ladipo was the one who started the process of documenting the guidelines for residency training as is typified by the peculiarity of the University College Hospital and the requirements of the Postgraduate Medical College and the West African College of Physicians.",
        "This is beginning to sound like a vote of thanks! In a way it is as this handbook would not have been made at all if not for what they established.",
        "The legacy of the founders and pioneers remains in the consultant team currently on ground in the department. Drs. 'Tola Ogunbode, 'Sola Mosuro, Lawrence Adebusoye, 'Femi Olowookere, 'Dotun Adetunji, 'Funmi Daramola, Sufi Muyibi and Yemisi Folasire are the embodiment of team spirit and commitment and have I truly been a delight to serve.",
        "Dr Ego lbeneme has always provided her wisdom and experience to guide us along. I am truly blessed and so are our resident doctors. May I just add that some of the work here was contributed with the effort of the resident doctors themselves and I would like to appreciate the Chief Residents past and present who often had to perform wonders with very little.",
        "This handbook starts with a two-page summary of the residency programme for Family Medicine Residents and is followed by a history of the department with excerpts from peer review journals and articles written on our founding heads of Department. Very useful information on the structure of the hospital as well as the functions of the Family Medicine Department, its collaborations, clinic protocols and assessment forms are presented concisely with easy numerical references. Really the Resident Doctors to Family Medicine have all the answers concerning their training needs and requirements addressed here.",
