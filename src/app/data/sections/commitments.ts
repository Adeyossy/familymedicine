        "The Department of Family Medicine works as a cohesive whole. To improve our professional and social lives, all doctors are expected to make contributions towards welfare of others and projects that benefit the residency training programme that are not covered by the federal government. The sum involved is agreed upon resident and consultant representative at meetings to weigh the cost benefit. Once our representatives have agreed to certain contributions, we are bound by honour to do so. Non contribution is looked upon as an act against progress and unity and can lead to investigation by peers and superiors."
