                "I have the honour of being the editor for the second version of the family medicine residency training handbook. It has been 11 years since the first edition (November 2011). There have been considerable improvements to the residency training while the challenges were surmounted as they came. Each challenge provided a learning opportunity.",
                "Going through the previous Editor's Note, one realises the historical perspective that it holds, hence its inclusion in the history section of this handbook.",
                "The initiative to revise the handbook came from the Head of Department, Dr Adedotun A Adetunji. He set up the Residency Handbook Review Committee in October 2022, comprising of the Residency Training Coordinator, Dr Kehinde Adigun, Dr ‘Bimbo Olorunsola (CME coordinator), Dr Oluwatoyin Olalemi, Dr Oyindamola Aderinto (Chief Resident), Dr Onaopepomipo Kolade (Senior Registrar), Dr Eniade Boriwaye (Registrar) and I. Even though Dr ‘Folajimi Senjobi was not part of the committee, he played a very important role in this edition especially for the abstracts of previous dissertations, a new feature added in this 2nd edition. Dr Olushola Mosuro coordinated the pictures, not a small feat!"
