        "Both postgraduate medical colleges expect resident doctors in family medicine to have hands-on experience in the Private Practice setting. This exposure equips the doctor with how to handle accounts in the hospital, hands-on procurement processes, personnel management, laboratory and blood bank logistics and so much more.",
        "Several hospitals have been approved to offer this training, while the senior registrar provides clinical services ensuring a win-win arrangement. Those hospitals closest to Ibadan and its environs are listed below.",
        "The residency training coordinator must be contacted as to a tentative plan for tutelage once the part I/membership examinations are successful, to ensure equity between service and training. The senior registrar is expected to have a positive response from the UI/UCH IRB committee for their dissertation proposal and their proposal(s) sent to the Colleges before they can set out to do their tutelage posting."
