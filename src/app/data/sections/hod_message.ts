        "This 2023 revision of University College Hospital, Ibadan (UCH) Family Medicine residency training handbook has a truly rich history spanning over 40 years of postgraduate training behind it.",
        "From the early days of handwritten guides for a lone pioneer resident, our training handbook has evolved through typewritten formats and paperback print to the current presentation as an electronic application.",
        "This digital aid to Family Medicine training is informed not just by fanciful pursuit of content upgrade, but by collective insight gleaned from the training program's defiance of several odds over decades (including the COVID-19 pandemic recently).",
        "Our new resident doctors should certainly be proud to engage this app and to provide insightful feedback for its improvement, knowing that by doing so they enter into and venerate a long line of Family Medicine stalwarts who have made their mark and have contributed to the legacy of one of the best training programs in the University College Hospital, Ibadan.",
