The family caregivers were administered a socio-demographic questionnaire; the 12th version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Experience of burden and psychological morbidity by the family caregivers was assessed using the ZBI and the GHQ-12 respectively. The physical morbidity of the family caregivers was accessed by measuring their Body Mass Index (BMI), blood pressure, glucose in the urine and Packed Cell Volume (PCV). Data obtained were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 20 for Windows. All statistical tests of significance were carried out at 5% level of probability."

Spousal caregivers dominantly constituted 27.4% of all participants, closely followed by daughters (25.5%) of the care recipients. Respondents who had been caregivers for> 12 months constituted 35.7%, while 33.1% and 31.2% of respondents had been in the caregiving role for 6-11 months, and < 6 months, respectively. The majority of participants (31.8%) invested 7-24 hours of caregiving per week, while 30.6% invested >48 hours per week. One hundred and thirteen respondents (72%) had a mean caregiver burden (ZBI) score of 36.07+/- 11.03. Participants with mild caregiver burden (52.2%) had a mean ZBI score of 30.46 +/- 5.50, those with moderate caregiver burden (17%%) had a mean score of 48.96 +/- 6.11 while those with severe burden (2.5%) had a mean score of 64.00 +/-2.45. Twenty eight percent of the respondents were rated as not having experienced any burden of care. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of factors associated with family caregiver burden was significant for (1) previous hospitalization of the care recipient (OR =3.74, CI: 1.67 to 8.38) and perceived dysfunction in patients (OR=2.57, CI: 1.14 to 5.78). The overall mean GHQ-12 score was 3.52 +/- 2.8. Sixty six respondents rated with no psychological distress had a mean GHQ score of 0.82 +/- 0.78. This was statistically different (p <0.0001) from the mean GHQ score 5.47 +/- 1.86 of 91 respondents with psychological distress. There was a statistically significant association between psychological distress and perception of caregiving burden (p < 0.0001); of the 91 respondents who reported psychological distress, 82 (72.6%) of them perceived caregiving burden. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of factors associated with psychological distress in caregivers was significant for caregiving inyolvement> 48 hours per week (OR = 3.83; CI:1.60-9.14). Only 33 (21%) of the caregivers were obese; 24 (15.3%) had hypertension; 18 (11.5%) had glycosuria and 46 (29.3%) had anemia. With respect to the assessed cO-morbidities (obesity, hypertension, glycosuria and anemia), the majority of participants had no co-morbidity. There was no significant association between presence of comorbidity and perception of caregiving burden (p > 0.05)."

                        "Family caregivers of women with advanced breast cancer experience clinically relevant burden of care. Significant predictors of family caregiver burden may include previous hospitalization of the care recipient and perceived dysfunction in care recipients' activities of daily living (ADL). Experience of burden is associated with psychological distress. Family Physicians being frontline doctors are likely to encounter patients who serve as family caregivers and therefore have a unique role of providing opportunistic interventions and coping strategies for reducing the burden of informal caregiving."

                        "HIV/AIDS still has no cure. The only known effective treatment remains antiretroviral therapy. However, adherence to antiretroviral medication is criticaly important for the success of the therapy. Overall rates of adherence are still suboptimal. Numerous factors may contribute to whether a patient is adherent to antiretroviral therapy, including social support and the presence of co-morbidities. Efforts to improve the modifiable factors that enhance drug adherence like effective diagnosis and management of co-morbidities in consideration of the interaction of these treatments with the HIV therapy as well as assessment of social support, are paramount in the nmanagement of PLWHA. The family physician is at the forefront of management of PLHWA at all levels of care."

A total of 400 participants were selected by systematic random sampling technique. An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to obtain data on socio-demographic and baseline HIV characteristics. Medication adherence was measured by a subjective self-report method using the simplified medication adherence questionnaire (SMAQ) and an objective method using a pharmacy refill method. Perceived social support was measured using the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS). Presence of the co-morbidities was obtained by self-report of the disease condition, and by physical examination and blood tests. Data collected was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17. Significance level of analysis was set at p 0.05."

The level of medication adherence was 70% and 59% using self-report and pharmacy refill log respectively. Family support was the best form of support. The overall total perceived support was better in males than females and males perceived more support from friends and significant others. About 46.3% had one or more of the c0-morbidities. Hypertension (36.8%) was the commonest of the three non HIV co-morbidities followed by obesity (21.8%). About 40% of the participants were on concurrent medications. Using the SMAQ, participants who perceived higher friend support were significantly more adherent.

However, the participants had overall good support and those who perceived support from their friends had better adherence. The study also showed a high co-morbidity (especially hypertension) among the participants. Although the co-morbidities studied did not have any significant association with medication adherence in this study, their presence may interfere with the overall burden and management of HIV/AIDS. Therefore, it is expedient to expand HIV care and intervention beyond HIV illness and treatment, to accommodate other co-morbid conditions."

The number of morbidities gradually increased with age while females recorded higher number of 3 or more morbidities. Emotional well-being domain of HRQOL recorded the highest score with mean 77.2 (SD17.3). The average QOL scores were higher in males than females. Across the age groups, general pattern observed was that the average QOL scores decreased with age and was statistically significant in most of the domains (p<0.001). In the illness perception domains, prioritization sub-domain recorded the highest score (Mean=2.0, SD+0.8). There was no significant difference between perceptions of males and females. However, emotional representation and prioritization sub-domains scores were higher in the younger age group. Association between illness perception and HRQOL domains was such that negative illness perception was associated with lower HRQOL. Following linear regression analysis, increasing age, female sex, lower education, employment, increasing morbidity and negative illness perception had negative association with HRQOL."

Information on socio-demographic characteristics, hypertension and medication history and anthropometric measurement were obtained. Perceived family support and medication adherence were measured by using perceived social support- family scale, and Hill Bone Compliance Scale-Short form (HBCS-SF) respectively. Practice of lifestyle modification was measured by using five healthy lifestyle changes (exercise, smoking cessation, moderate alcohol, normal body mass index and >5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily)."

The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity in this study were 10.0% and S.070 respectively, with relative 4.9% underweight. More females had higher body mass index than males in all the age groups, most especially at the adolescent age. The significant socio-demographic risk factors associated with the development of childhood overweight and obesity in this environments were, age, sex, and high Socioeconomic class. High maternal educational was protective against childhood. Obesity Regular visits to restaurants, consumption of animal proteins and consumption of beverages and snacks were significantly associated with childhood obesity. Extra hours spent on coaching lessons after school hours was the only significantly associated sedentary lifestyle associated with the development of childhood obesity in this study. The prevalence of elevated blood pressure was high in the study population with systolic hypertension as l6.1% and the diastolic was 5.0%, more females had elevated level of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure was more among the obese and overweight in the study than the normal weight respondents. None of the respondents had frank diabetes but the overweight had more impaired fasting blood glucose than the obese. Rather hypoglycaemia was found more among both the normal weight and the overweight. The lipid profiles were not significantly elevated, except the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and the total cholesterol. Twenty percentage (22.0%) of the obese were dissatisfied about their body weight, though more were still happy about their body image., but the majority, 42.1%, of those who were dissatisfied about their weight were in the adolescent age groups and 69.2% of the obese will therefore prefers to loose weight."

The knowledge score was significantly associated with the level of education (p=0.031) with a positive correlation (correlation value=0. 35). Only 9 (3.5%) of the 254 subjects have heard about Pap smear and only 3 (1.28) had had the test done prior to this study. The knowledge score on Pap smear was also poor. While no significant association was found bet ween knowledge score and the unemployed and lowly employed, the low educated, the married and other variables; it appeared that the younger women, women with low parity had better knowledge on Pap smear. The source of information on cancers in general was more of television/radio (37.7%) followed by friends and colleagues (36.08). While Friends and colleagues were the most mentioned source of information on Pap smear. The level of educat ion was significantly associated wi th source of informat i on on Pap smear (p=0.003). The less educated appear to have heard the information more from the non-media - friends and colleagues and patients with disease. In this study, only 11(4. 3%) of the women studied reported for screening. This constituted 5.18 of the 215 subjects that were willing to be screened. Result of cytology was available for 10 of the 11 subjects screened. None of the 10 whose results were available was positive for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) Inflammatory smear was reported in 9 (81.8%) of the subjects, atrophic cervicitis was found in an elderly woman aged 65 years and the result of one of them could not be traced. The government and private (mostly) hospitals were found to be the most patronized by subjects with better knowledge about cancer of the cervix and Pap smear."

There are numerous reports that the maternal mortality seen in pregnant women cannot be explained by the physical illness alone. This has further led to the belief that there are psychological effects of the stressful conditions which acting in concert with the physical illness may account for the mortality. Effective social support has been reported to ameliorate the stressful condition. There are no studies on this subject in Nigeria. The ability of family physicians to transcend the physical, social and mental components of patients is of unique value in reducing maternal morbidity in pregnancy."

Also, quality of life of the respondents was assessed using the structured 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. A detailed physical examination and finger prick for haematocrit check was done on the participants. The data collected was entered, cleaned and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0. Contraceptive use was dichotomized into current use and non-use. The quality of life was analyzed according to its eight dimensions (the physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional stress, vitality, mental health, social functioning, bodily pain and general health) and also categorized into the two main domains (physical and mental domains). The scores of the two domains were dichotomized as worse than average' or average or better', based on the average of the respective scale components. Mean and standard deviations were used to summarize quantitative variables while frequencies and proportions were used for qualitative data. Chi- square statistics was used to test for the association between categorical variables. Independent t-test was used to compare categorical variables with continuous variables. Level of significance was at 5%. A logistic regression was used to predict the determinants of contraceptive use among the participants."

Blood pressure reduction ranged between 12% and 15%.  Hydroflumethiazide at doses of 50mg daily and 50mg twice daily along with Moduretic at a dose of one tablet daily gave rise to similar reductions in blood pressure after two weeks of therapy.

Propranolol at daily doses ranging between 160mg and 320mg did not give rise to significant reduction in blood pressure except in the sitting diastolic blood pressure at daily doses of 320mg. It was the only drug to cause a reduction in heart rate. As expected, both hydroflumethiazide and Moduretic gave rise to increased incidence of hyperuricaemia and hypokalaemia. However, the latter was less than expected, in view of the reported lower serum potassium levels in normal Nigerians and Nigerian hypertensives compared to in the western world and Caucasians. Despite the presence of amiloride a potassium sparing diuretic in moduretic, the fall in serum potassium remained similar to HFM. None of the drugs had any significant effect on random blood sugar, despite reports that all three drugs could cause significant rise in blood sugar level. Moduretic caused a significant reduction in serum sodium and an increase in blood urea. Propranolol therapy resulted in significant reductions in serum sodium and chloride. Hydroflumethiazide was the only drug to cause significant increase in creatinine. Despite these findings, all these indices remained within normal limits. All drugs had no effect on haematocrit.

                        "Approximately 50% of patients in primary care have neuroses including anxiety. Anxiety Disorders (AD) may be the primary illness or secondary to a physical or psychological illness leading to disturbing clinical manifestations, that affect family life and work productivity.  AD arises from an interaction of genetic, psychological and social factors.  As family members are often exposed to similar factors, similar illnesses occur in its members. The G.P./F.P. has the training to seek and understand these common familial factors thereby making the management of anxiety a required skill set. AD diagnosis can be made when 4 out of the 17 symptoms listed in the 10th Edition of the International Classification of Disease (ICD - 10) are present. However, AD is better assessed using standard instruments like the Zungs Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) providing an objective scoring system for re-evaluation. Management of AD may be pharmacotherapeutic, psychotherapeutic or both.  Short Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (STDP) is quick with a fewer number of sessions required. Anxiolytic medication give significant symptom relief, but relapse and dependence occur frequently.  A combination of both modalities of treatment has been found to be superior in the management of AD in the western world."

Only 82 persons, were recruited for the study, having SAS scores greater than 45 (9%).  Group A  had 43 patients while Group B had 39 patients. Participants ages ranged from 15 to 60 years.  The median and mean age in Groups A and B were 29/31.5 and 28/32 years respectively.  There was no significant difference in the distribution of the sociodemographic variables; sex (p = 0.162), marital status (p = 0.228), occupation (p = 0.0642), and socio-economic status (p = 0.524). There were more educated participants and Christians in Group A (both p = 0.000). The mean duration of consultations in Group A was 16.9 minutes and  13.1 minutes for Group B (p = 0.000). The variability of the duration of consultations in each group along the 4 weeks was found to be significant (p = 0.0021).  The initial consultation was much longer than the subsequent ones (22 mins for Group A vs 15 mins for Group B; p = 0.000). Consultation time was slightly longer for males in group A compared to females in the same group.  This trend was not seen for Group B.  In both groups no males came for the 4th consultation. There was a similar distribution of SAS scores in each group (t = 1.307; df =79, p = 0.1950). These ranged from 45  69 points with the majority having 45 - 54 points.   At the 2nd consultation most patients scored 35 - 39 points in Group A and 50 - 54 points in Group B (t = 5.743, df = 63, p = 0.000) while the scores were 30 - 39 points in Group A and 40 - 44 points in Group B for the 3rd consultation (t = 4.949, d.f = 36, p = 0.000).  By the 4th consultation most patients scored 30 - 34 points in Group A and 45 - 49 points in Group B indicating a return of significant anxiety (t = 5.183, df = 18, p = 0.000). Overall, both groups showed significant improvement in their SAS scores with similar number of defaulters. The most common reason for encounter associated with anxiety was secondary infertility at 15.6%, followed by malaria (14.1%) and dyspeptic symptoms (11%). Physical examination findings such as tachycardia, rise in systolic blood pressure, tachypnoea, increased borborygmi, increased muscle tone, brisk deep tendon reflexes, decrease in muscle power occurred in both groups equally, except for more tachycardia in Group A on week 1 that declined in both groups over time/treatment. Both groups had only 1 participant with mild anaemia. ECG was done in 74% of Group A participants (20 were normal and 12 abnormal). In group B, 62% had an ECG (all normal).  Abnormalities found were sinus tachycardia, mild to moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, and left atrial enlargement (n=2)."

Most patients present at a point in time when they feel their symptoms are beyond their control. The benzodiazepines produce rapid symptomatic improvement, rekindling confidence in coping strategies so that psychological treatments are persisted with, behavioral modifications are adhered to and psychodynamic links between past experiences, current thoughts and feelings, more fruitfully explored.  Psychological treatment, vice versa, improves drug compliance and improves confidence in the efficacy of prescribed medication.  Fears concerning unwanted side effects and possible addiction can be assuaged. The difficulty in performing psychotherapy is ascribed to the duration of intervention.  This study conducted amongst others patients during the normal working day, gives an indication of the feasibility of STDP in the GP/FP setting. The mean duration of consultation was found to be significantly greater in the group receiving STDP at 16.9 minutes compared to the group with medication only (13.1 minutes).  The difference was greatest at the first consultation but subsequently became insignificant, with even a slightly higher mean duration for patients in Group B presenting the same psychosomatic complaints over again."

                        "Two hundred and eighty two subjects aged between 25 and 95 years were selected by systematic random sampling. There were more females with a male to female ratio of 1:1.82, and the mean age with standard deviation was 59.3 +/- 13.4 years. The study determined that 58.9% of subjects studied had satisfactory anti-hypertensive medication adherence based on a  Morisky Medication Adherence Scale score of 6 or more. Belonging to an extended family household and the presence of family financial support were the family factors significantly associated with medication adherence. Subject's attitude or level of agreement with the idea of taking daily anti-hypertensive medications continuously, was directly correlated with medication adherence, while proximity of the hospital to subjects' residence was the health care facility related factor associated with medication adherence. The factors most significantly associated with anti-hypertensive medication adherence as determined by logistic regression were family household type, obesity status based BMI, subjects' attitude to the idea of taking daily anti-hypertensive drugs continuously, subjects' access to the hospital based on proximity and socio-economic class. Obesity was discovered by this study to not only be a risk factor for the occurrence of hypertension, but also a detrimental factor against anti- hypertensive medication adherence and blood pressure control. The blood pressure control rate in this study was 40.1% with isolated systolic hypertension (15.6%) being seven times commoner than isolated diastolic hypertension (2.1%). Subjects' lack of appropriate knowledge about hypertension, the use of more than one antihypertensive pill as well as two or more doses of prescribed anti-hypertensive drugs per day, were the patient related and drug related factors associated with poor blood pressure control respectively."

                        "There was a consistent statistically significant association between blood pressure control and medication adherence based on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS). Since researchers have noted that many physicians did not acknowledge adherence to therapy as a barrier to blood pressure control in their hypertensive patients, this study highlights the need for physicians to deliberately identify non-adherent hypertensive patients so as to take proper decision(s) about effective treatment, aimed at increasing blood pressure control rate. The findings of this study supports the proposition of local and foreign literature on the preferred use of a suitable single pill anti-hypertensive drug (possibly as fixed drug combination) and/or once daily dose medication for improved medication adherence and effective blood pressure control in hypertensive patients in our environment."

Significantly, more married respondents (73.4%) had high functional health score, compared to (44.3%) of those not married (p=0.000). A third (35.6%) of the respondents had a history of knee osteoarthritis in the family. Out of the 270 respondents studied, 146 (54.1%) reported restriction in performing duties at work. One hundred and twenty-seven respondents (47.0%) needed some assistance in walking outside the house for 15 to 20 minutes, whilst 195 (72.2%) required some assistance in climbing stairs. Males are twice more likely to have a better functional health than females (OR= 2.1, 95% CI=1.0- 4.6, p=0.046). The most prevalent co-morbidities were those of the musculoskeletal systems (68.1%); this was followed by 11.5 % of the respondents presenting with symptoms related to the cardiovascular systems and 7.0 % of the respondents presented with symptoms related to the general or non- specific or eye complaints respectively. In this study, a higher proportion of the respondents (37.3 %) were obese, 34.1 % were overweight, 25.6 % were normal weight, while 3.0 % were underweight. The majority (68.8%) of the respondents perceived an adequate level of social support from their family members, majorly from their children. Individuals who perceived strong support from their family (69.9%) and friends (71.6%) had a good health perception at a p-value of 0.002 and 0.037 respectively. Respondents (92.2 %), (85.4 %) and (72.6 %) with strong support from their families, friends and significant others respectively also had higher functional health status.

The Primary Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire somatoform, anxiety and depression modules (PRIME-MD PHQ-SADS) was used to screen for psychosomatic morbidity and severity while Stevenson's family developmental model using the age of first child) was used to group participants into emerging, crystallizing, interacting and actualizing family. The Social Readjustment rating scale (SRRS) and General Self Efficacy were used to explore the perceived family related stressors and perceived self-efficacy of participants respectively. The clinical manifestations of participants were classified according to international classification of primary care second electronic version (ICPC-2E). Analysis was done using statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 17 and associations were explored using independent t test and analysis of variance."

They were selected using systematic random sampling after they met the inclusion criteria. The data collection instruments used included the Family Relationship Index and International Classification of Primary Care second edition. Information sought included socio-demographic characteristics, the family dynamics of the caregivers and the presenting complaints of the under-five febrile children. Other information were the pre-hospital treatment of febrile illnesses in under-five children, the physical examination findings and laboratory results of malaria parasite test. Data was analysed using statistical package for the social sciences version 17. Descriptive statistics such as proportions, mean (SD) and range, were used to summarize data and data was presented in tables, graphs and figures as required. Assoclation between the categorical variables was tested using the Chi-square test. Multivariate analysis was used to explore variables with pre-hospital treatment. The statistical significance level was set at a P value of< 0.05."

Majority of the febrile children, 217 (89.7%) had pre- hospital treatment. The treatments which were basically drug and non-drug were received in their homes, mentioned by 127 (58.5%), from chemists 89 (41.4%) and traditional homes 1(0.5%). The most used drugs were antipyretics mentioned by 176 (81.1%) followed by antimalarials 66 (30.4%). About half (49.8%) of the respondents purchased the drugs used for pre-hospital treatment from chemists. Antitmalarial drug use within 24 hours of onset of fever was reported by 52 (21.2%) pre-hospital treated children. Mothers' deciding on pre-hospital treatment (=7.818, p 0.003) and parents' definition of fever as 'increase in body temperature in addition to other symptoms' favoured pre-hospital treatment (=6.793, p= 0.009). The prevalence of malaria was 10.7% (by microscopy) and 12.4% by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Using ICPC-2 classification, there were a total of 693 morbidities and the highest four morbidities in descending order were found in respiratory system 166 (24%), endocrine/nutritional/metabolic systems 160 (23.1%), general and unspecified system 135 (19.5%) and digestive system 110 (15.9%). Malaria is classified under general and unspecified system in 1CPC-2. The family dynamics revealed that only 45 (18.6 %) of the children were in support-oriented families with the larger percentage, 197 (81.4%) in conflict oriented families. Larger proportion of the febrile children were in families with low cohesion, 162 (66.9%), high conflict 133, (55%) and high expressiveness 137 (56.6%). Under-5 children in support-oriented families with high cohesion, high expressiveness and low conflict had more pre-hospital treatment but there was no statistically significant association between family dynamics and pre-hospital treatment."

Family physicians as part of the holistic care of patients in the context of the family should device means of strengthening the family cohesion and family bond as this will not only lead to better outcome in the pre-hospital treatment of the under-five child but also improve the health-seeking behaviour of caregivers for the under-five child."
